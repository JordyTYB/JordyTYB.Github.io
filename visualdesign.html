<p>I used the grid and also used the rectangle tool as my main tool. My projects are mostly rectangles.There is a deli next to a supermarket. I also did a parking lot for a building and I made another white building. The most challenging part was making buildings 3 dimensional. I had to do a lot of adjustments for it to look good.
